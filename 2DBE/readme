The sixth problem to solve is the Two-Dimensional Burgers Equation. The codes contained within this folder are the following:

1. W6_BE2D_OptSweep. This code corresponds to the resolution of the 2DBE a number of times compared to the Hopf-Cole proposed integral solution.
The data to obtain the results is contained at the file "Data_BE2D_Sweep.mat".

2. W6_BE2D_TwoStaged. This is the two-staged optimization method discussed in the NSE method. 
In particular, the datafile will be provided "Solution_BE2D.mat".

3. W6_BE2D_Ex. This is the baseline code for the resolution of the problem used as a reference.
