# BT_PINN_Approach_to_Solve_PDE
This is a repository containing the different MATLAB codes and the .mat archives with the data samples that are referenced to within my thesis.

Each of the folders will correspond to one of the results sections, and will be added (if applicable) with the particular .mat file that contains any large database that was used in the obtention of results.

The folders will be enumerated here in order as they are appear in the Bachelor Thesis.

1. 1DHE. The One-Dimensional Heat Equation
2. 1DWE. The One-Dimensional Wave Equation
3. 1DBE. The One-Dimensional Burgers Equation
4. 2DHE. The Two-Dimensional Heat Equation
5. 2DWE. The Two-Dimensional Wave Equation
6. 2DBE. The Two-Dimensional Burgers Equation
7. NSE.  The Simplified Navier-Stokes' Equation
