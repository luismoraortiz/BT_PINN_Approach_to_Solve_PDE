# BT_PINN_Approach_to_Solve_PDE
This is a repository containing the different MATLAB codes and the .mat archives with the data samples that are referenced to within my thesis.

Each of the folders will correspond to one of the results sections, and will be added (if applicable) with the particular .mat file that contains any large database that was used in the obtention of results.
