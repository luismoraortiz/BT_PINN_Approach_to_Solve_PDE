The fourth problem to consider is the 2DHE, that is, the two-dimensional Wave Equation. The codes obtained in that context are the following:

1. W5_WE2D_OptSweep. This corresponds to a sweep of the 2DWE problem using the Optimal Architecture with Dirichlet BCs.
The data is available at the file "Data_WE2D_OptSweep.mat".

2. 

3. W5_WE2D_Dirichlet. This is the code that solves the Wave Equation in two-dimensions using Dirichlet Boundary Conditions.
