This is the first problem that was analyzed during the thesis, that is, the one-dimensional Heat Equation. The codes contained in here are the following:

1. W1_HE1D_ErrorMeasure. This consists on analyzing the errors in the 1DHE problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions for 100 different samples.
The results will be available at "Data_1DHE_Performance.mat".

2. W1_HE1D_Collocation. This consists on analyzing the errors in the 1DHE problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions for 4 different collocation routines.
The results will be available at "Data_1DHE_Collocation.mat"
