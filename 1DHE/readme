This is the first problem that was analyzed during the thesis, that is, the one-dimensional Heat Equation. The codes contained in here are the following:

1. W1_HE1D_ErrorMeasure. This consists on analyzing the errors in the 1DHE problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions for 100 different samples.
The results will be available at "Data_1DHE_Performance.mat".

2. W1_HE1D_MeshComps. This consists on analyzing the errors in the 1DHE problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions for 4 different collocation routines.
The results will be available at "Data_1DHE_Collocation.mat"

3. W0_OptimComps. This code consists on the comparison of optimization methods applied to solve this problem with a shallow 2-layered model.
The results will be available at "OptimComps.mat" and the ADAM solver in "fms_adam.m" retrieved from DylanMuir's GitHub.

Beyond the scope of the Bachelor Thesis
- W1_HE1D_ActivFunction. This is a code that attempts to compare the errors in the problem using different types of Activation Functions.
