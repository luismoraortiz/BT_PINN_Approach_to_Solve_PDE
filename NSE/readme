These will correspond to the problems that are solved in the context of the Navier' Stokes Equations.

1. Couette_Flow. This corresponds to the Couette regime across a channel of length 2 and width 1. 
The data needed to easily access this problem is in "Report_Couette.mat" that represents a successful solution.

2. Poiseuille_Flow. This corresponds to the Poiseuille regime across a channel of length 2 and width 1.
The data needed to easily access this problem is in "Report_Poiseuille.mat" that represents a successful solution.

3. LDCF_VelForm_2S. This is the solution for the two staged Lid Driven Cavity Flow using the velocity formulation. It will be the one used in the report
The data needed to easily retrieve the graphs are in "Report_NSE_Re1.mat" and "Report_NSE_Re50.mat".

4. LDCF_VelForm_1S. This is a different solution to the one before in that it is single-staged instead of two-staged. (Could be used, lower accuracy and efficiency).

5. LDCF_Streamf_1S. This is the original code using the Streamfunction formulation. It has not successfully been applied within this BT.
