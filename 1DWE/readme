This is the second problem to be tackled during the Bachelor Thesis, that is, the One-Dimensional Wave Equation. The codes contained here are the following:

1. W2_WE1D_MeshComps. This is the study of four different meshing procedures for the 1DWE, assessing how the modify the performance metrics.
The data is available in the document "Data_WE1D_Collocation.mat". Another dataset, "Data_WE1D_Collocation2.mat" was also used for some metrics (with larger c parameter).

2. W2_WE1D_VelProps. This is the study of the velocity of data transmission c and how it affects the performance metrics of the solution. 
The data is available in "Data_WE1D_Propagation.mat".

3. W2_WE1D_Dirichlet. This corresponds to the solution of the 1DWE with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions.
